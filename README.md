# Currently i am working on:
Implementing a simple cryptocurrency plattform in C++

# My uploaded codes so far:

# Python

## Python Project number 1:

- pulling data from yahoofinance and creating a common joint dataframe for the column Close pro ticker.
- Creating weights pro ticker for the portfolio and calculating VaR, considering normal distribution.

## Python Project number 2:

- pulling data from yahoofinance and calculating technical analysis indicators with talib library.

## Python Project number 3:

- pulling data from yahoofinance on AAPL, calculating mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness and
- testing if returns are normally distributed or not.

# C++

## C++ Project number1: Ccy converter.

- The currency converter asks the user to input the amount of EURs, CHFs, GBPs the user has, along with the exchange rates
- for EUR_USD, CHF_USD and GBP_USD and splits out the equivalent amount in US$.

## C++ Project number2: GPA calculator

The GPA calculator calculates the GPA of a student for a semester for 3 courses (mathematics, biology and physics) based on:
 - grades from A+ to F
  - and ECTS points
  - The user defines the grades on a range from A+ to F and the ECTS points
  - the total GPA is calculated by the formula of
  - GPA = ((math_ects * math_grade_in_numbers) + (biology_ects * biology_grade_in_numbers) + (physics_ects * physics_grade_in_numbers))/(math_ects+biology_ects+physics_ects);

## C++ Project number3: RockpaperScissor game

One round of RockpaperScissor game:
- The user chooses Rock, Paper or Scissor and
- the computer chooses a random of the three (corresponding to a random number).
- an If loop compares user input with random computer number and splits out the text who won/lost.
  
## C++ Project number4: Using function incl. a loop

We are given 3 lines of input.
- Each line consists of 2 space separated integers - A and
- For each input - you need to compute and output the following on separate lines:
- A + B
- A^2 + 2*AB + B^2
  
## C++ Project number5: The Fahrenheit Celsius converter using functions

Fahrenheit Celcius converter:
- The user enters the direction he wants to convert based on the printed out menu.
- The user enters the amount of grade he wants to convert.
- The result gets printed out to the console.

## C++ Project number6: The product purchase price calculator using functions
- The purchase price calculation for a product is based on Listenpreis (list price), der Menge (quantity), dem Skonto (discount), dem Rabatt (discount2) und den Versandkosten (shipping costs)
- The user enters the all variables, the discounts in %.
- The result gets printed out to the console.

## C++ Project number 7: TIC TAC TOE.
- The user decides who starts the game (The user or the computer).
- Grid 3x3 is drawn and defined by rows and columns
- Game ends with draw or win or lose.
